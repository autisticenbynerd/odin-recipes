        This website is serving two purposes. It is part of the Recipe Project/Assignment in the
        foundation course of The Odin Project in which I'm currently competing. I have also
        been invited to submit a website layout to a layout marathon in which the theme is food, so I 
        have decided to combine the two websites into the one to make things easier for me.
